# Our second model: regressors, working, not working, working again

Let's look at something together that works: neural net-based regressors.

First, let's look at one in action. P.A. will show his favourite patch. And poke a bit. Nice noises.

Then, let's poke a bit further. And see what it is good at, by opposition to other regression methods.

Then, let's break it, as we try to implement the simplest of approaches. This is the default status of neural network: not working. So we need to give a few concepts and tricks and ways to nudge them and look how well/unwell they do. Then, we should have it work again, hopefully.

It should be fun.
