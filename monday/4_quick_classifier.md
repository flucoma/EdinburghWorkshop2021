# Our first model: A quick classifier

Right. Let's make something. 

In this chunk, OG will live patch, with all yous following along, and we're going to use FluCoMa's multilayer perceptron classifier object (`fluid.mlpclassifier~`) to make the quickest, dirtiest thing we can that will distinguish between different bits of audio. 

We'll start start minimal, and then introduce a couple of refinements. The idea being to show 
* you can get something going quite quickly, with just a few objects 
* that there are some things to bear in mind whilst training neural networks
* some possible ways of making such things more robust
